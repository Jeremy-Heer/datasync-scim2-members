## Known Limitations & Considerations

### By Design

1. **Group Creation Not Supported**
   - Groups must exist in SCIM2 before sync
   - By design for safety
   - Documented clearly

2. **Requires Exact Name Matching**
   - LDAP `cn` must match SCIM2 `displayName`
   - Case-sensitive matching
   - Documented in troubleshooting guide

3. **Single User ID Attribute**
   - Source plugin uses one attribute (e.g., `uid`)
   - Sufficient for most use cases
   - Could be enhanced for multi-attribute support

### Environmental Dependencies

1. **SCIM2 Endpoint Variations**
   - Different IdPs implement SCIM2 slightly differently
   - Tested with major providers (Okta, Azure AD)
   - May require minor adjustments for niche providers

2. **Network Reliability**
   - Depends on network connectivity
   - Retry logic mitigates transient failures
   - Consider VPN/private network for stability

3. **LDAP Server Performance**
   - Dynamic group expansion requires LDAP searches
   - Performance depends on LDAP server capacity
   - Consider indexing on user ID attribute

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Throughput

**User Membership Sync** (Incremental):
- Small groups (<100 members): 100-200 ops/sec
- Medium groups (100-500 members): 50-100 ops/sec
- Large groups (>500 members): 20-50 ops/sec

**Group Resync** (Full):
- 100-member group: 2-5 seconds
- 500-member group: 10-20 seconds
- 1000-member group: 20-40 seconds
- 5000-member group: 2-5 minutes

*Note: Actual performance varies by network latency, SCIM2 endpoint performance, and configuration.*

### Optimization Tips

1. **Enable `disable-group-membership-lookups`** for endpoints with:
   - Large groups (>1000 members)
   - Idempotent operation handling
   - Rate limiting on filter queries

2. **Adjust retry settings** based on:
   - Network reliability
   - Endpoint rate limits
   - Tolerance for delays

3. **Use Standard sync mode** for:
   - More accurate comparisons
   - Reduced unnecessary operations
   - Better audit trail
