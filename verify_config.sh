echo ""
echo "   When disable-group-membership-lookups is NOT specified (default):"
echo "   - Destination checks current group memberships using members.value filters"
echo "   - Skips redundant add operations if user is already a member"
echo "   - Skips redundant remove operations if user is not a member"
echo "   - More accurate but potentially slower with inefficient SCIM2 endpoints"
echo ""
echo "   When disable-group-membership-lookups IS specified:"
echo "   - Destination always sends group membership operations without checking"
echo "   - May result in redundant API calls but avoids members.value filter queries"
echo "   - Better performance when SCIM2 endpoint doesn't support efficient filtering"
echo "   - Ideal for endpoints that handle duplicate operations gracefully"
